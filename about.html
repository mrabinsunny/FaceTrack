        <p>At FaceTrack, we pride ourselves on being pioneers in the realm of group facial-recognition based attendance systems. Developed by a dedicated team of experts including Abin Sunny, Abid Muhammed, Aiswarya Lakshmi, and Ancita J Feriah, FaceTrack offers cutting-edge technology designed to streamline attendance processes for educational institutions, businesses, and organizations of all sizes.</p>
        <p>Our platform boasts two intuitive modes for attendance tracking. The first mode harnesses the power of facial recognition technology, allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple faces and seamless attendance capture.
